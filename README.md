# Basic ChatBot using Machine Learning  
                      
## üìå Overview      
  
This project is a **Basic ChatBot** built using **Machine Learning** techniques. The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user queries based on predefined intents. It utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** models to classify user inputs and generate appropriate responses.   

## üèÜ Key Features  

- **Intent-based responses**: Uses a trained model to classify user input into predefined categories.    
- **Machine Learning-driven**: Implements ML algorithms to enhance chatbot accuracy.  
- **Flexible and customizable**: Users can modify intents and responses easily.  
- **Preprocessing pipeline**: Includes tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization.  
- **Neural Network model**: Uses a deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras) for text classification.  
- **Interactive experience**: Provides a simple user-friendly interface for chat.  

## üîß Technologies Used  

- **Python** - Programming language for chatbot development.  
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** - Used for text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization).  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** - Deep Learning framework for training the classification model.  
- **NumPy & Pandas** - For handling datasets and numerical computations.  
- **Scikit-learn** - For text vectorization (TF-IDF, CountVectorizer) and model evaluation.  
- **Flask** (optional) - To deploy the chatbot as a web application.
